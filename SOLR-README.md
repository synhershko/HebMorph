Tutorial for integrating HebMorph with Elasticsearch can be found here http://code972.com/blog/2013/08/129-hebrew-search-with-elasticsearch-and-hebmorph

## Solr installation guide

## Prerequisites

* Solr (Versions supported: 4.10.x and above).

* A Solr Collection.

( If you do not have these already set-up, please refer to http://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html#tutorials )

* hebmorph-lucene.jar (can be downloaded from ***).

* Hebrew dictionary files. The open-sourced hspell files can be downloaded from https://github.com/synhershko/HebMorph/tree/master/hspell-data-files.

## Integrating HebMorph
In this guide, I'll be using 'example' as my <b> instanceDir </b>, and 'collection1' as my <b> core </b>. Replace those with yours. If you don't know them, you can easily find them by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cores (replace with your host:port).

Add the following line to solrconfig.xml which can be found at solr/<i>collection1</i>/conf directory, within your solr-instanceDir. For example [solr home]/<i>example</i>/solr/<i>collection1</i>/conf/solrconfig.xml.
```
    <lib path="PATH/TO/hebmorph-lucene.jar" />
```
Replace PATH/TO/hebmorph-lucene.jar with the location of your hebmorph-lucene.jar

Now, you need to place your dictionary files in one of the predefined locations. Currently, you should place the dictionary files in the home of you solr <b> instanceDir </b> folder. That is, [solr home]/<i>example</i>/ folder.

You need to define your schemas. If you do not know how schemas work in Solr, refer to http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml.
Open your schema file ([solr home]/<i>example</i>/solr/<i>collection1</i>/conf/schema.xml). The easiest way to quickly add your desired analyzers is to replace the "text-general" fieldtype. That way, all default text values will be analyzed using hebmorph.
Locate
```
	<fieldType name="text_general" class="solr.TextField" positionIncrementGap="100">
      <analyzer type="index">
        <tokenizer class="solr.StandardTokenizerFactory"/>
        <filter class="solr.StopFilterFactory" ignoreCase="true" words="stopwords.txt" />
        <!-- in this example, we will only use synonyms at query time
        <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="index_synonyms.txt" ignoreCase="true" expand="false"/>
        -->
        <filter class="solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory"/>
      </analyzer>
      <analyzer type="query">
        <tokenizer class="solr.StandardTokenizerFactory"/>
        <filter class="solr.StopFilterFactory" ignoreCase="true" words="stopwords.txt" />
        <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="synonyms.txt" ignoreCase="true" expand="true"/>
        <filter class="solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory"/>
      </analyzer>
    </fieldType>
```

And replace it with
```
    <fieldType name="text_general" class="solr.TextField">
		<analyzer type="index" class="org.apache.lucene.analysis.hebrew.HebrewIndexingAnalyzer" /> 
		<analyzer type="query" class="org.apache.lucene.analysis.hebrew.HebrewQueryAnalyzer" />
    </fieldType>
```

HebMorph contains 4 different hebrew analyzers for you to choose from:

HebrewIndexingAnalyzer: <description>

HebrewExactAnalyzer: <description>

HebrewQueryAnalyzer: <description>

HebrewQueryLightAnalyzer: <description>

That's it. Restart Solr and your chosen analyzer(s) should automatically apply when querying or indexing new data.

In order to see if the analyzer works, browse to the Analysis section in solr-admin (http://localhost:8983/solr/#/<i>collection1</i>/analysis). Write any phrase ("בדיקת עברית"), select any fieldname which represents a text ("content","title", etc.) and analyze. Then, choose the fieldtype "text_en" and analyze. You should see the clear differences.

## Commercial

Hebmorph is released open-sourced, alongside with hspell dictionary files. The Commercial option will grant you further support in making Hebrew search even better, and it comes with a proprietary dictionary. For more information, check out http://code972.com/hebmorph.
